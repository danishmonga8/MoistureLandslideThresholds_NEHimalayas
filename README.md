# MoistureLandslideThresholds_NEHimalayas
This repository hosts data and code for analyzing moisture-driven landslide thresholds in the Northeastern Himalayan region. It focuses on the spatial variability of landslide triggers, integrating environmental and hydrometeorological controls to support the development of region-specific Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWS).
